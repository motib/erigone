    Promela programs for Erigone

    http://code.google.com/p/erigone/.

The archive that is available for the book is intended for use with
the Spin model checker. I have developed Erigone, a Spin-compatible
model checker that is intended for educational use. This archive
contains Promela programs that can be used with Erigone, possibly with
straightforward modications.

The following abbreviations are used:
       
i/b -- replace "int" with "byte"
ltl -- replace defined atomic propositions by #...#
    -- and negate the LTL formula (which jSpin did automatically)
for -- replace the use of the "for" macro with guarded commands
lit -- replace the use of a defined identifer by a literal
ns  -- the program demonstrates a construct not supported by Erigone

Chapter 01
counting        OK, i/b, ltl
for             deleted, ns (preprocessos)
gcd             OK, i/b
if1             OK, i/b, replace b=-4 by b=4
if2             OK, i/b, year=2000 to year=0
if2-conditional deleted, ns (conditional expressions)
max             OK, i/b
mtype           OK
mtype1          OK, use one mtype declaration for all symbols
rev             OK, i/b, replace value=123 by value=120

Chapter 02
divide1         OK, i/b
divide2         OK, i/b
max1            OK, i/b and replace conditional by boolean expression

Chapter 03
count           OK
cs0             OK
cs              OK
dstep           OK
init            OK
interleave1     OK
interleave2     OK
interleave3     OK

Chapter 04
end             OK
end1            OK
relay           OK, for
sem             OK
third-abbrev    OK
third-atomic    OK
third-do        OK
third           OK

Chapter 05
first-ncs       OK, ltl
fourth-liveness OK, ltl
peterson-over   OK, ltl
stopA           OK, i/b

Chapter 06
sparse          OK, i/b, lit, for, remove negative numbers and typedef
sum             OK, i/b, for, declaration of "sum" to start of proctype
sum2            deleted, ns (inline)

Chapter 07
listing-7-1        OK
listing-7-2        OK
listing-7-3        OK
listing-7-4        OK
listing-7-4-verify OK
listing-7-5        OK
listing-7-5-run    OK
listing-7-5-verify OK with minor changes
listing-7-6        OK, ltl
listing-7-7        OK
listing-7-8        OK, remove inline

Chapter 08
fa              OK, replace timeout by else, lit
fa1             OK, replace timeout by else, lit, remove inline
sat             OK
sat3            OK, break up the expression which is too long for Erigone
sat(others)     deleted, too big for the Erigone configuration

Chapter 09
dining          deleted, too big for the Erigone configuation
priority        deleted, ns (priority)
unless          deleted, ns (unless)

Chapter 10
generate        OK, for
generate1       OK, for
sem-prog        deleted, ns (progress labels)

Chapter 11
The programs in this Chapter use too many unsupported features and are
too large for Erigone. (An exception is Fischer's algorithm which works
after small changes.)

Now is the time to start using Spin!!
