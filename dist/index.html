<p><b>Erigone</b> is a partial reimplementation of the <a
href="http://spinroot.com/">Spin Model Checker</a>. The goal is to
facilitate learning concurrency and model checking. Erigone implements a
large subset of Promela; no language constructs are added so that
programs for Erigone can be used with Spin when more expressiveness and
better performance are desired.</p>

<p><b>Trace</b> is a postprocessor for Erigone that formats the output
of a simulation in a tabular form that can be customized in terms of
what statements and variables are displayed.</p>

<p><b>VMC</b> is a postprocessor for Erigone that can automatically
generate diagrams of the generation of the state space of simple Promela
programs during a verification. </p>

<b>EUI</b> is a GUI development
environment for Erigone. (EUI is an adaptation of the
<a href="../jspin/index.html">jSpin</a> environment for Spin.) </p>

<h3>The design of Erigone</h3>
<ul>
<li>Erigone is single, self-contained, executable file
so that installation and use are trivial.
<li>Erigone produces a detailed trace of the model checking algorithms.
The contents of the trace are customizable and a uniform keyword-based
format is used that can be directly read or used by other tools.
<li>Extensive modularization is used in the design of the Erigone
program to facilitate understanding the source code. This will also
enable researchers to easily modify and extend the program.
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>
Examples of the output of Erigone for the <i>Second Attempt</i> at
solving the critical section problem (see Ben-Ari (2005)):
<ul>
<li><a href="second-assert-simulate.txt">A random simulation run</a>,
which results in a violation of the assertion of mutual exclusion.
<li>The above random simulation reformatted
by the included postprocessor <a href="second-assert-trace.txt">Trace</a>.
<li><a href="second-assert-verify.txt">Verification of safety</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Software downloads</h3>
<ul>
<li>The source and binary archives are in the Erigone project at Google Code:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/erigone/">http://code.google.com/p/erigone/</a>.
<li>The source and binary archives for the EUI development environment
are in the jSpin project at Google Code:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jspin/">http://code.google.com/p/jspin/</a>.
</ul>
Both archives of both projects contain example programs and
documentation.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
The following Guides can be downloaded separately, but may not
be as up-to-date as that in the project archives.
<ul>
<li><a href="erigone-quick.pdf">Erigone Quick Start Guide</a>.
<li><a href="erigone-ug.pdf">Erigone User's Guide</a>.
<li><a href="eui-quick.pdf">EUI Quick Start Guide</a>.
<li><a href="eui-user.pdf">EUI User's Guide</a>.
<li>A paper about Erigone <a href="BenAri-Spin09.pdf">Teaching
Concurrency and Model Checking</a> that was presented at the SPIN 2009
Workshop.
(It can also be <a href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/ws09/BenAri.pdf">downloaded<a>
from the Spin webiste.)
</ul>

<h3>Promela programs</h3>
Promela programs in the archives supplied with my textbooks has been
adapated as far as possible for use with Erigone. They can be downloaded
from the Erigone project or here.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="psmc-erigone-2009-09-29.zip">source code of the
programs</a> from my textbook <a href="http://www.springer.com/978-1-84628-769-5">
Principles of the Spin Model Checker</a> adapted for use with Erigone.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Erigone is written in <a href="http://www.sigada.org/">Ada 2005</a> for
reliability, maintainability and portability. No non-standard constructs
are used. The <a href="https://libre.adacore.com/">GNAT</a> compiler was
used; it is available in free, academic and commercial versions.
The Erigone software is copyrighted under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.
Prior to Version 2.0.0, Erigone used a Promela compiler developed by
<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/~tk883/">Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy</a> at
New York University under the supervision of Edmond Schonberg. This
version is available in the SVN repository in the branch ErigoneP.
