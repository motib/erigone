<p><b>Version 3.2.5 (14.12.12)</b><br>
&nbsp; Fixed bug: statistics not printed as long integer.
&nbsp; Fixed bug: literal in ltl not being compiled.
&nbsp; Fixed bug: atomic not stored as part of the state.
&nbsp; Fixed bug: null transitions should not be written to trail.

<p><b>Version 3.2.4 (08.12.12)</b><br>
&nbsp; Fixed bug with atomic.

<p><b>Version 3.2.3 (19.11.12)</b><br>
&nbsp; Fixed bug for negative values of type short.

<p><b>Version 3.2.2 (07.11.12)</b><br>
&nbsp; Fixed bug: Trace was not displaying the last line of a
simulation. 

<p><b>Version 3.2.1 (01.08.12)</b><br>
&nbsp; The VMC tool has been extended to generate graphical
representations of simulations in addition to verifications. 

<p><b>Version 3.2.0 (16.07.12)</b><br>
&nbsp; Support for random search diversity. Some limits have been
increased for the Promela models for the Tseitin clauses and a Java
program is included to generating them.

<p><b>Version 3.1.2 (03.06.12)</b><br>
&nbsp; Since internal LTL formulas were allowed, an LTL to Buchi
automaton translation must be done within a compilation and not as a
separate step. This version performs clean-up of the deprecated mode. 

<p><b>Version 3.1.1 (29.12.11)</b><br>
&nbsp; The number of transitions per process has been increased.

<p><b>Version 3.1.0 (7.11.11)</b><br>
&nbsp; The display of the state space from within Erigone has been
removed and replace by a separate program VMC that analyzes the trace
output of Erigone.

<p><b>Version 3.0.1 (17.04.11)</b><br>
&nbsp; "#define" can now take parameters and be used in LTL formulas.

<p><b>Version 3.0.0 (12.04.11)</b><br>
This is a major upgrade; the main changes are:<br>
&nbsp; Support for additional Promela constructs including the new
ones from Spin 6.<br>
&nbsp; The addressing was changed from a flat address space to one
where addresses are (process offset, variable offset).<br>
&nbsp; The addition of a preprocessor to support <tt>inline</tt>,
embedded LTL formulas and <tt>for</tt> and <tt>select</tt>.<br>
&nbsp; Bug fixes: short-circuit <tt>&&</tt> and <tt>||</tt>; nested
<tt>do-od</tt>.<br>
&nbsp; <tt>list</tt> program for formatting the compiler output.

<p><b>Version 2.1.5 (17.03.10)</b><br>
&nbsp; Give error messages for absent ; or ->.<br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: extra end of lines at end of file are ignored.<br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: "break" as only alternative of if or do.<br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: degeneralization of LTL formula did not clone byte code.<br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: backtracking over "run".

<p><b>Version 2.1.4 (26.02.10)</b><br>
&nbsp; User's guide and software documentation separated.<br>
&nbsp; Quick start guide added.

<p><b>Version 2.1.3 (27.09.09)</b><br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: "np_" is not supported but keyword was spelled
wrong.<br>
&nbsp; Increase size of byte codes for expression in LTL formula.<br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: compilation of "byte a[...], b[...]".<br>
&nbsp; Added increment and decrement of array elements.<br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: "run" in program with never claim.<br>
&nbsp; Added skip statement.<br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: nested if-statements.

<p><b>Version 2.1.2 (26.09.09)</b><br>
&nbsp; Bug fix: verification with rendezvous channels.<br>
&nbsp; Remove limitations on multiple mtype declarations, channel arrays
and declarations after statements.

<p><b>Version 2.1.1 (26.09.09)</b><br>
Erigone was used on the sample programs supplied with my book
<i>Principles of the Spin Model Checker</i>. This used many more
constructs in Promela and uncovered quite a few bugs that are fixed in
this version.<br>

<p><b>Version 2.1.0 (20.09.09)</b><br>
&nbsp; Supports display of the state space (like SpinSpider in jSpin).<br>
&nbsp; Support for remote reference to labels in LTL formulas.

<p><b>Version 2.0.0 (03.09.09)</b><br>
&nbsp; This is the first version with a new compiler.<br>
&nbsp; Additional constructs supported: proctype with parameters,
run, _nr_pr, _pid, end and accept labels.

<p><b>Version 1.1.4 (05.08.09)</b><br>
&nbsp; This was the last version with the old compiler.
It will not be supported in the future.

<p><b>Version 1.0.0 (12.02.09)</b><br>
&nbsp; Initial release.
